# Rock Paper Scissors:

This is a simple console-based rock-paper-scissors game implemented in C#. The program prompts the player to enter their move (either rock, paper, or scissors), and then randomly generates a move for the computer. The two moves are compared, and the program determines the winner (or whether it was a tie) and displays the result.

It is also important to mention all of the solutions to making this code:

C# programming language: I used C# to implement the logic of the rock-paper-scissors game, including user input, random number generation, and game outcome calculation.

- .NET Framework: I used the .NET Framework to provide the necessary runtime environment for the C# code to run on.

- Console.WriteLine and Console.ReadLine methods: I used these methods to prompt the user for input and display output on the console.

- System.Random class: I used the System.Random class to generate random numbers for the computer's move.

- Colorful.Console library: I used the Colorful.Console library to add color to the console output, making the game more visually appealing.

- Visual Studio: I used the Visual Studio as our development environment, providing a suite of powerful tools for writing, debugging, and testing my code.
